## Relase a package update
This repo uses [github-actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-workflows) that automatically publish a new package whenever there a new release is published at. A release is automatically created when run eg. `npm version patch`.

You have basically 3 ways of increasing the version number (full explanation in package.json)
0. Merge your branch to the main-branch. Switch over to the main branch and:
1. Publishing a small patch? Run - `npm run version:patch`
2. Publishing a minor update? Run - `npm run version:minor`
3. Publishing a major update? Run - `npm run version:major`

Whenever the tag is pushed, simply go under releases, edit the pushed tag. Give it a title and description, then publish it.
